 create an integer constant, unimaginatively called ‘Constant1’, with the value 96.

```cpp
const int Constant1=96;
```
declares that Constant2 is a variable pointer to a constant integer and

```cpp
const int * Constant2
```
or 
```cpp
int const * Constant2
```
declares that Constant3 is constant pointer to a variable integer and
